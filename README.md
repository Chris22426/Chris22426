Hi, I'm Chris22426, or Chris for short. 
I am a Python programmer. 
I specialise in developing Discord bots in Python using the discord.py library, but have experience in a few other sectors as well, with many other librarys. 
I also have experience with making games using Unreal Engine.
If you have any enquiries, feel free to leave me an email at chris270305@icloud.com or message me on Discord (Chris22426#0001).
