Hi, I'm Chris. 
I am a Python and Javascript programmer. 
I mostly develop Discord bots using Discord.py and .js, but have experience in a few other sectors as well, with many other librarys. 
I also have experience with making games using Unreal Engine.
If you have any enquiries, feel free to message me on Discord (Chris22426#0001).
