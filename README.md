Hi, I'm Chris22426, or Chris for short. 
I am a mentally insane Python programmer. 
I specialise in developing Discord bots in Python using the discord.py library. 
I'm also experienced in controlling and manipulating a MongoDB Database using the pymongo library. 
I also have experience with making games using Unreal Engine. 
If you have any enquiries, feel free to leave me an email at chris270305@icloud.com or message me on Discord (Chris22426#0001).
